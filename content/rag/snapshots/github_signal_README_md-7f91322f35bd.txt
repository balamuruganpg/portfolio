# Signal · Cloud SLA Monitor

<p align="center"><strong>Observe the signals. Investigate the breaches. Understand your SLA.</strong></p>

Signal turns cloud telemetry into a clear view of uptime, response time, error
rate, and availability. Explore trends, investigate threshold breaches, and
understand sample compliance through a Streamlit dashboard with vibrant visuals,
a light theme, and a pure black dark theme.

Run a reproducible simulation locally, or connect an optional read-only Google
Cloud Monitoring source.

Developed as a **mini project for U23CS702 — Cloud Computing Virtualization (CCV)**
at **Nehru Institute of Technology**.

## Full dashboard screenshot

The complete dashboard, captured in the light theme: metric cards and sparklines,
interactive telemetry, reliability radar, incident pulse, request traffic, error
budget, breach heatmap, latency distribution, and diagnostic observations.

**Click the screenshot to open the original 2880 × 6094 image.** The capture uses
simulated telemetry; the displayed values reflect its snapshot and settings.

### Light & pure black themes

The appearance controls sit above the dashboard. Dark mode uses a **#000000**
page and sidebar with neutral black cards; light mode uses white cards and a
soft background. Theme switching preserves the current snapshot and controls.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ recommended; Streamlit 1.66+ required.
No Google Cloud account is needed for simulation.

From the project folder, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/balamuruganpg/cloud-sla-monitoring-system-ccv-mini-project.git
cd cloud-sla-monitoring-system-ccv-mini-project
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). If you already have the
project, start from its folder and skip the clone commands. If `.venv` already
exists, skip its creation. Launch with its Python executable to
use the installed dependencies instead of an older global Streamlit version.

### Try the dashboard

1. Keep **Simulation** selected and choose an observation window.
2. Explore a metric, or select **Compare all** to view four separate metric plots.
3. Enable **Stress test** to demonstrate more frequent and severe anomalies.
4. Adjust **SLA thresholds** and see how the same telemetry scores against them.
5. Open **Incidents** to filter breaches and export the matching records as CSV.

Use the visible **Light / Dark** controls above the dashboard to switch
appearance while preserving your snapshot and settings. Use **Refresh snapshot**
to update the observation window; collection does not run continuously in the
background.

## Features

### A connected reliability workspace

**Overview** brings the latest service readings and historical compliance
together. **Incidents** turns failed checks into searchable, exportable records.
**Data & guide** exposes the source samples and explains the calculations for
demonstrations and review.

### Beyond a collection of charts

| Area | What you can explore |
| --- | --- |
| **Metric cards** | Latest readings, target status, window compliance, and colored sparklines for four SLA metrics. |
| **Telemetry explorer** | Interactive time series with hover details, zoom, breach markers, rolling averages, and a four-metric comparison view. |
| **Reliability profile** | Switch between a radar chart and compliance scores to identify the weakest signal. |
| **Incident pulse** | A colored timeline showing the maximum simultaneous breaches within each group of samples; hover or focus for details. |
| **Traffic & budget** | Request counts per sampling interval and an estimated availability error budget with burn rate. |
| **Breach activity** | A date/hour heatmap revealing when metric checks failed. |
| **Latency distribution** | In-target and outside-target samples with median, P95, and SLA boundary markers. |
| **Incident investigation** | Metric, severity, and text filters; filtered CSV export; and a metric scorecard. |
| **Data & guide** | Raw telemetry, CSV download, methodology, and a five-step presentation walkthrough. |
| **Appearance** | Light and pure black dark themes, responsive cards, and motion effects that respect reduced-motion preferences. |

The sidebar offers 24-hour, seven-day, and 30-day windows, plus custom dates
covering up to 60 calendar days. Sampling resolution adapts to the window.
Timestamps in the dashboard and exports use **Asia/Kolkata (IST)**.

### Visual analytics in action

![Dashboard analytics with time-series exploration, reliability radar, incident pulse, and request traffic](artifacts/dashboard-visuals-v2.jpg)

Hover for exact readings, drag to zoom into a time range, or compare four
metrics in separate plots with their own units. The radar uses a 0–100 compliance
scale; the incident pulse makes groups of simultaneous breaches easy to spot.

## System architecture

```

Source adapters provide the samples, the analyzer evaluates the targets, and
the dashboard presents the results. Changing a threshold re-evaluates the same
snapshot so comparisons remain meaningful.

## How the analysis works

The core algorithm is **threshold-based SLA evaluation**. Each sampled reading
is compared with its configured target using an inclusive comparison:

| Metric | Default target | A sample passes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uptime | 99.9% | Reading ≥ target |
| Response time | 200 ms | Reading ≤ target |
| Error rate | 0.1% | Reading ≤ target |
| Availability | 99.95% | Reading ≥ target |

```text
Metric compliance (%) = passing samples / total samples × 100
Composite score (%)  = mean of the four metric compliance percentages
Violation deviation  = absolute difference between reading and target
```

**Example:** if 285 of 288 uptime samples meet the target, uptime compliance is
**98.96%**. If all four compliance scores are 98.96%, 100%, 97.22%, and 100%,
the composite is **99.05%**. This measures passing checks across the selected
window, separately from the latest reading.

Each failing metric reading becomes a violation record. Records are sorted by
timestamp and assigned a severity from their absolute deviation:
**Warning** below 0.05, **Moderate** from 0.05 to below 0.5, and **Critical** at
0.5 or above. These buckets use each metric's own units, so compare severity
within a metric.

Diagnostic observations use rules such as lowest compliance, business-hour
concentration, and gaps between violations. They guide investigation; they do
not establish root causes or use a trained machine-learning model.

### Interpreting the visuals

- **Latest status and window compliance answer different questions.** A latest
  reading can pass even when earlier samples breached the target.
- **The composite score is sample compliance**, not contractual uptime.
- **The availability error budget estimates loss** from availability percentages
  over observed intervals. Telemetry gaps are excluded; this is not measured
  outage duration.
- **Heatmap cells show the share of failed metric checks** in each date/hour.
  Blank cells mean no samples.
- **Latency median and P95 describe sampled interval values**, not individual
  request latencies. Traffic bars show counts per interval, not requests/minute.
- **Threshold changes reuse the same telemetry.** A fixed simulation seed
  reproduces the scenario; refreshing advances the observation window.

## Google Cloud setup (optional)

1. Enable `monitoring.googleapis.com` in your Google Cloud project.
2. Configure Application Default Credentials or set
   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to your credential file path.
3. Grant the credential's account the `roles/monitoring.viewer` role.
4. Enter the project ID in the dashboard, or set `GCP_PROJECT_ID` or
   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` before launch.
5. Select **Live GCP** in the sidebar.

The adapter reads uptime checks and Cloud Run request-count/latency metrics.
If Cloud Run request data is absent, it tries HTTPS load-balancer metrics. It
computes error rate from HTTP 5xx request counts, weights latency distribution
means by sample counts, and aligns observations by timestamp. Availability
shares the uptime-check observations in this integration.

Missing credentials, permissions, metric streams, or aligned coverage trigger a
clearly labeled **simulation fallback**. Missing data is never replaced with
invented healthy readings. Authenticated ingestion requires your own cloud
project and is not covered by local UI verification.

See the [Google Cloud Monitoring metric catalog](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp)
for metric definitions.
